# A cute experimental Discord bot called Shelter 

A fun side project to experiment with Discord and Discord.js to create a bot.


## INSTALLATION
Before you start create a `.env` file with the following content :

```
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
BLIZZARD_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_BLIZZARD_CLIENT_ID"
BLIZZARD_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_BLIZZARD_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

Run `npm install` to install all the required packages to run the bot

## START
If you want to watch the files for changes use nodemon : `nodemon`

If you don't care about watching for file changes use : `node app.js`


## USAGE 

Type commands in the chat room : 
```
!help: show all the available commands of the bot.
```
