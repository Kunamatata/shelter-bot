# Shelter 

My first discord bot that I wrote with Node.js


#### Installation
Before you start create a `.env` file with the following content :
```
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
BLIZZARD_API_KEY="YOUR_BLIZZARD_API_KEY"
```

Run `npm install` to install all the required packages to run the bot

#### Start
If you want to watch the files for changes use nodemon : `nodemon`

If you don't care about watching for file changes use : `node app.js`


#### Usage 

Type commands in the chat room : 
```
!help: show all the available commands of the bot.
```
