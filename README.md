# Shelter 

My first discord bot that I wrote with Node.js


#### Start
If you want to watch the files for changes use nodemon :
```
nodemon
```
If you don't care about watching for file changes use : 
```
node
```


#### Usage 

Type commands in the chat room : 
```
  !help: show all the available commands of the bot.
```
